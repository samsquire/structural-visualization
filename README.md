This repository is the idea we can use coloured grids to represents trees by adding rules to the reading of the grid.

These rules are as follows:

* we switch between horizontal and vertical rendering for efficient use of space
* children are listed from left to right

See this diagram, the grid at the top represents the tree. Notice the colour codings.
